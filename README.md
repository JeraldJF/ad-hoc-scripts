```
This file is used to define questions that will appear in quizzes. Each row represents one question. You can add as many options as needed by continuing the pattern: option_3, option_3_is_correct, and so on.

| Column                | Description                                        |

## Status Reports

The scripts will generate status reports in the following locations:

### Quiz Creation Reports
- `src/reports/question_status.csv`: Contains status of question creation status
- `src/reports/quiz_report.csv`: Contains status of quiz creation operations
- `src/reports/quiz_question_status.csv`: Contains status of question creation and attachment to quizzes

### Learner Profile Creation Report
- `src/reports/learner-profile-status.csv`: Contains the learner profile creation status.

### Course Enrollment Report
- `src/reports/enrollment-status.csv`: Contains the course enrollment status for the user.

### Quiz Language Update Report
- `src/reports/quiz-update-status.csv`: Contains the quiz language update status.

These reports will contain detailed information about the success/failure of each operation, including any error messages if applicable.

## Troubleshooting
