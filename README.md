## CSV File Format

Each CSV file is like a spreadsheet with rows and columns. The first row contains column names. Below is a guide to what each column means for different CSV files.

### Questions Data CSV Columns

Used to upload questions with multiple options and answers.
```csv
code,question_text,score,option_1,option_1_is_correct,option_2,option_2_is_correct,...[n number of options with proper number]
```
This file is used to define questions that will appear in quizzes. Each row represents one question. You can add as many options as needed by continuing the pattern: option_3, option_3_is_correct, and so on.

| Column                | Description                                        |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `code`                | Unique codes for the question (e.g., `QZ101`)      |
| `question_text`       | The question text (e.g., *What is the capital...*) |
| `score`               | Points awarded for the correct answer              |
| `option_X`            | Answer choice text (X = 1, 2, 3...)                |
| `option_X_is_correct` | `TRUE` if correct, `FALSE` otherwise               |

Example row:
`QZ001, What is the capital of France?, 5, Paris, TRUE, Lyon, FALSE, ...`

### Quiz Data CSV Columns

```csv

```
This file describes a quiz, including its name, type, language, and which questions are included.

| Column         | Description                                          |

```
This file links learner profiles to specific courses and when access expires.

| Column                 | Description                                                 |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |

```
This file links user emails to specific learner profile codes for enrollment.

| Column                 | Description                                              |

| `learner_profile_code` | Learner profile codes used to enroll users in courses    |

Example row:
`user@example.com, LP001`


## Status Reports

The scripts will generate status reports in the following locations:

### Quiz Creation Reports
- `src/reports/question_status.csv`: Contains status of question creation status
- `src/reports/quiz_report.csv`: Contains status of quiz creation operations
- `src/reports/quiz_question_status.csv`: Contains status of question creation and attachment to quizzes

### Learner Profile Creation Report
- `src/reports/learner-profile-status.csv`: Contains the learner profile creation status.

### Course Enrollment Report
- `src/reports/enrollment-status.csv`: Contains the course enrollment status for the user.

These reports will contain detailed information about the success/failure of each operation, including any error messages if applicable.

## Troubleshooting

1. Check the generated status reports in the `src/reports` directory for detailed error information
2. Verify that all required environment variables are set correctly
3. Ensure the CSV files are properly formatted according to the expected schema
